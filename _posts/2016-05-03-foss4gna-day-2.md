# Keynote

* Andreas: NC HB2 Legislation -> conference venue has been great

## Jerry Johnston: US Dept Interior

### NSDI

Been a great 'success'

* unified catalog
* shared costs
* Massive # of datasets

*so WHAT?*

* metadata not machine readable
* only small fraction of datasets available via web services

Moving forward:

* Scalable web services
* 170 Core datasets
* All datasets available with web services
* Allow 3rd party management of products on provided infrastrucure
* Better search knowledge graph
* Easy sharing/map collaboration

# Beyond Mapping Population Density: Cartography for Big Data

Speaker: Mamata Akella
Room: 301B
[Abstract](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/beyond-mapping-population-density-cartography-big-data)
[Slides](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/sites/default/files/slides/Cartography%20for%20Big%20Data-%20FOSS4G%202016.pdf)

### Big data display

*10k points per map tile, tens of millions of points*

* display all points
* glow maps: better to highlight higher density areas
  * Can add categories
* Aggregation: bin to a grid and apply counts per variable

### Torque

* typically for time series/animcations
* Can use static SQL aggregate with statistics to bins

### Deep insights

* multi dimensional pattern analysis (categories, histogram)
* real-time filtering
* seems really fast... displaying tiles generated from the vector information

### Map Demo

* graduated symbols not weighted: just set width from calculated breakpoints

### Thoughts

* sample dataset contained 30m points... how much would that cost?
  * didn't know
* how do you normalize non locational information to a point?
  * You don't, all points must contain geospatial info

# Awaken the QGIS Within

Speaker: Gretchen Peterson
Room: 301A
[Abstract](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/awaken-qgis-within)

### Beginner project setup with QGIS

Set up a basic map with labeled roads/coffee shops.

1. CRS setup
1. background color
1. add datasets
1. Style lines
  1. rule based renderer: SQL where clause
1. Line labels
  1. show labels for layer, Museo Sans font
  1. placement = curved
1. Style coffee shops maker
  1. draw effects = drop shadow
1. Coffee shops lables
  1. text buffer
1. new shapfile layer
  1. define attributes
  1. add point tool
  1. Add style -> draw effects
  1. Add label

### Print composer

1. Set size
1. Add map to page
1. Update extent to match map view
1. Lock layer extent/styles
1. Overview map
  1. Need to adjust original map document to appropriate layer/extent
  1. Any way to maintain both sources?
1. Title
  1. White to transparent fill, can adjust orientation
1. Re-order in items list

### Tips

1. Inverted polygon to highlight an area
1. Inverted starburst symbology

# Climbing the data mountain: Scaling and optimizing the delivery of vector tiles

Speaker: Jake Guthmiller [mySidewalk]
Room: 302C
[Abstract](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/climbing-data-mountain-scaling-and-optimizing-delivery-vector-tiles)
[Slides](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/sites/default/files/slides/Climbing%20the%20data%20mountain_0.pdf)

Visualize census data across US (800 attributes, 14 layers)

Vector tile generation:
* # clients, 
* # requests
* tile complexity (features/tile + feature complex)
* # attributes

### Architecture

* client: leaflet.mapboxvectortile
* tileserver: tilestache (mapzen)
* db: pgpool
* cache: redis
* load balance: nginx
* microservices

### Client

* domain sharding (a.*, b.*, c.*)
* CORS: preflight requests -> Add auth in req

### Load balancer

* use cpu, network
* nginx
  * connection pooling to tile servers

### Tile server

* set cache control headers
* db connection pool, cache connection pool
* Mapzen version
  * uses PostGIS to cut tiles rather than shapely/python
  * Proper Mapbox vector tiles

### Microservices

* Tilestache: wants file for layer config -> Add REST endpoint to requst config from

### Redis Cache

* redis-py: hiredis parser (C bindings)

### Database

* pgpool II
  * connection pooling
  * streaming replication
  * load balancing

### Client rendering

* Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile - canvas
* MapboxGL - webGL

### Deployment

* Google cloud platform
  * compute
  * container registry
  * monitoring (stackdriver)

### Autoscaling

* Swarm, Mesos, Kubernetes, OpenShift

# Marine Protected Area Mapping - Promoting Awareness, Compliance, and Enforcement via Open Data and Tools

Speaker: Virgil Zetterlind [Anthropocene Institute]
Room: 301A
[Abstract](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/marine-protected-area-mapping-promoting-awareness-compliance-and-enforcement-open-data-and)

Create a central map of all marine protected areas

### Challenge

* multiple administrative orgs
* not mapped, only verbal description -> draft regions sent to org for review
* Regulations change
* Coastlines change w/ contradictory shapes for multiple orgs

### Date upkeep

* Sounds like epic amounts of work...
  * Change detection on websites -> notified -> check it out
  * External URLs checked with monthly script for existence -> check it out

*All very manual*

* Massive struggles with data management

# [GeoWave](https://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/): Visualizing Massive Datasets

Speaker: Rich Fecher [RadiantBlue Technologies]
Room: 301B
[Abstract](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/geowave-visualizing-massive-datasets)

### Demo

* Fast distributed scalable storage / retrieval of geospatial data
* key:value store (Accumulo)
  * Data must undergo dimensionality reduction (2D -> 1D)

* 1.19 Billion rows
* Query returns from 20 node cluster in a couple seconds

### Architecture

* Amazon EMR 20 node cluster 4 core large
* Accumulo

Visualizing GPS Tracks with [RikiTraki](https://www.rikitraki.com/)

Speaker: Ricardo Morin
Room: 304
[Abstract](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/visualizing-gps-tracks-rikitraki)

Motivation: Share GPS tracks from hiking trips

* Photos matched to GPS track by time if lat/lon not avail (with time adjustment)
* Nice UI with elevation profile, geolocated pictures
* Cesium layer for 3D viz

Architecture

* Leaflet *and* Cesium
* Bootstrap/JQuery front end
* Backend REST API in nodejs/express
* MongoDB database

Tips?

* Globalsign: free certs for open source
* Javascript finite state machine

# In-browser, scale-independent geo data analysis using vector tiles

Speaker: Anand Thakker [Development Seed]
Room: 302C
[Abstract](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/browser-scale-independent-geo-data-analysis-using-vector-tiles)
[Slides](anandthakker.github.io/talks/foss4gna-2016)

### In browser interactive analysis

* geoJSON (turf.js?)
  * Size limited, scale issues
* PostGIS
  * Complexity, round tripping

Same problems as rendering tiles... piggyback?

### How

* Building vector tiles
  * Simplify/drop features when rendering (tippy canoe?) OK, not for statistics
  * solution: running total for arbitrary grid cell -> aggregate
* Data driven styling
  * mapbox-gl-datadriven (polyfill - separated to layers, style by bins)

### vt-grid
* tilereduce (aggregates raw data)
* tippecanoe (takes gridded data, makes tile)
