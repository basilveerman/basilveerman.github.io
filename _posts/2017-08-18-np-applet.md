title: Ubuntu Network manager issues
---

I have recently refresh Ubuntu 16.04 on my Dell XPS 13. All is well... mostly. One recurring issue is that after restore from sleep, the network manager would (sometimes) show that I wasn't connected to any wireless network and would appear that networking was disabled. But it was.

Restarting `network-manager` was not sufficient and the network manager applet would then simply dissapear. 

As per [this SO answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/699062), killing and starting the applet fixed the issue.

```bash
sudo service network-manager restart
killall nm-applet; nohup nm-applet &
```
