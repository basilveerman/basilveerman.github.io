# Autoscaling PostgreSQL at Scale (OpenShift)

## Slide notes

* Redhat is *all in* on containers
  * distant future: containers for all os services

### Docker tips

* clean up after apt-get/yum
* set user running default process to anyting but root
* Docker best practices: https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/creating_images/guidelines.html

### Kubernetes

PROBLEM: Docker not good at sharing network between contianers

SOLUTION: assemble into a pod to talk over localhost

* FS mounted at pod level
* scheduling affinity configurable with lables
* Makes persistent storage available to entire cluster (persistent volume)
* Service = proxy + load balance

## Demo

* Use Kubernetes secrets for sensitive information

## Thoughts

* Demo went pretty badly due to user errors/errors in workshop notes, but when working, you can really see how this *could* work for deploying highly available/scalable apps
* Openshift seems like just a management layer for kubernetes for environment variables, scaling, etc.
* The postgres container we spun up with build in replication was cool, but really just a preconfigured Docker instance with replication and sourcing config for other instances using environment variables.
