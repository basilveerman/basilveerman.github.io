# TileReduce: Distributed Spatial Data Processing in JavaScript

Speaker: Morgan Herlocker (Actually Tim Channel @tcql)
Room: 301A
10:30 - 11:05
[Abstract](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/tilereduce-distributed-spatial-data-processing-javascript)
[Slides](http://morganherlocker.github.io/talks/tile-reduce/)

### Details

* written in nodejs - browser use case not yet shown, too much data
* distributes analysis across cores: 1 worker per cpu cores
* splits input into tiles, or sources from mbtiles
* tiles processed through map scripts (map reduce-ish)
* data sources: exclusively mapbox vector tiles
* data made availabe as vector-tile-js or geojson in mapping function

### Uses

* changeset analysis: osm
* automated osm analysis: map new features, detect

### weirdness

* vector tiles made for rendering, not analysis.
  * must take that into account when generating
* use low zoom levels: more tiles with less data slower than less tiles with more data
* vector tiles buffered for rendering, but analysis must not use buffer
* not actually mapreduce... but similar-ish

### Questions:

* Simplification issues? on by defaul creating mbtiles
  * Turn it off for analysis
* Performance compared to spark
  * Haven't looked at results
  * Happy with what they've got: 12-20 mins global job
* Uneven data, why use rigid tile sizes
  * Not wasting enough time processing low data/empty tiles to make it worthwhile
